Hey there,

First, make sure you change the user name and password in your PixCoin.conf file.
Then move it to this location:
C:\Users\**Your user name here**\AppData\Roaming\PixCoin\

The final path of the PixCoin.conf file should be:
C:\Users\**Your user name here**\AppData\Roaming\PixCoin\PixCoin.conf

If you want to use the mining feature of the wallet add this line to the PixCoin.conf file
gen=1
